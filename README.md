## 🔍 About

[R-Type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-Type) is a 3rd year Epitech project where a group of 4-6 students have to code an ersatz of the original horizontally scrolling shooter arcade video game from 1987 of the same name. In the span of 2 months, the goal is to learn the [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) architectural pattern to code the game in C++ with an additional 2-4 players coop.
